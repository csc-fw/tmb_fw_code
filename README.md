# tmb_fw_code
## TMB_FW_2021_CCLUT branch
This branch included new features ported from new OTMB firmware
   - CCLUT algorithm
   - High multiplicity trigger(HMT)
   - new trigger data format and DAQ data format
   - new VME registers to control above features

But unfortunately the compilation failed because too many resource are used. Need to test the version with less new features probably
